        <p>
          Summer is nearly here! We love this season because it's the perfect
          time to eat all the great oraganic vegetables from our neighboring
          farms. One way to enjoy the delicious abundance of fresh fruits and
          vegetables is in salads. However, at Two Trees we <em>refuse</em> to eat boring
          , tasteless salads. Therefore, we're going to share with you the
          reasoms to make your own, and the basics for creating custom salad
          dressings.
        </p>

        <h4>Make you own salad dressing Sure</h4>
        <p>
          Sure, the grocery store is full of salad dressings, but <strong>often they're
          full of preservatives that impact the taste and nutritional value of
          the dressing</strong>. Furthermore, they can sit on the shelf for a long time
          before they're bought, which can further reduce the nutritional value
          of the product.
        </p>

        <p>
          To get started designing you own custom dressing, you need as little
          as two ingredients: an oil and an acid. From there you can get as
          creative as you like.
        </p>

        <h4>Homemade salad dressing is good for your health</h4>
        <p>
          Olive oil contains polyphenols which, according to research, can play
          a role in slowing cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Olive
          oil also has antioxidant properties. Reasearch into vinegar shows it
          might be slightly helpful with controlling the body's glycemic
          response. Together there's no doubt, they're delicious!
        </p>
        <p>
          We use this basic combination here in our
           <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/212896/caprese-appetizer/" target="_blank">
             <abbr title="bite-sized Caprese salad
             appetizer">BSCS</abbr></a> using mini mozzarella balls and cherry tomatoes. We serve
          this with our basil infused olive oil and aged balsamic vinegar. It's
          amazing!
        </p>
        <h4>Make it to your taste</h4>
        <p>
          There are four main ingredient types to consider when making a salad
          dressing: fat, acid, sweetener, and spice. For fat we recommend olive
          oil because it carries flavor so well and it has so many healthy
          properties, though you can definitely try different oils or healthy
          fats like avocado.
        </p>
        <h5>Acids</h5>
        <p>
          the two most common acids in a salad dressing are vinegars and fruit
          juices. You'll want to pick the flavors that you think will bring the
          most out of your salad components. This might require some delicious
          experimentation!
        </p>
        <dl>
        <dt>Vinegars: </dt>
         <dd>Apple cider</dd> 
         <dd>rice</dd> 
         <dd>balsamic</dd>
        
        <dt>Fruit juices: </dt> 
        <dd>Lemon</dd> 
        <dd>lime</dd> 
        <dd>orange</dd>
        <dd>grapefruit juices</dd>
        
    </dl>
        <h5>Sweeteners</h5>
        <p>
          Sugar is a common sweetener used in store-bought salad dressings.
          However, we recmmend trying a sweet fruit juice like orange or a
          natural sweetener like agave or honey. In fact, if you want an
          amulsifier in your dressing, honey is an excellent choice. A nice
          benefit of making you own dressing is that you can control how much
          added sugar is going into you food.
        </p>
        <h5>Spice</h5>
        <p>
          Start with salt. A little can go a long way and bring out the natural
          sweetness in your fruits and vegetables. Experiment with herbs like
          rosemary, mint, basil, or tarragon. If you're wanting some extra zip
          or an emulsifier, try Dijon mustard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trick to making a brilliant salad dressing is to explore flavors
          and flavor combinations you enjoy. Take some time this summer and have
          fun experimenting with the abundance of healthy foods and flavors!
